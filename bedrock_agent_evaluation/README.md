# Bedrock Agent Evaluation

We are using [AWS Agent Evaluation](https://github.com/awslabs/agent-evaluation) to test and validate our Amazon Bedrock agent. This framework allows us to simulate multi-turn conversations, evaluate responses, and integrate tests into our CI/CD pipeline. By leveraging built-in support for Amazon Bedrock and custom targets, we ensure the stability and performance of our agent.
